 + Added further FTP compatibility feature: "Ignore IP returned by server in passive mode" - If enabled in the FTP destination, the (local) IP address returned by the FTP server will be ignored (useful for servers behind NAT) and instead the servers public IP address will be used. Can help with "Operation now in progress" errors or other directory listing/transfer issues.

===== 2.12.7 =====
 * Fixed a potential security issue: Reflected XSS via GET parameters in backend/manual export area. If "Add secret keys to URLs" is enabled in the backend (which should hopefully always be the case!) this should have been nearly impossible to exploit though.

===== 2.13.5 =====
 * Email destinations: Fix for double UTF8-encoded email subjects

===== 2.13.6 =====
 * Email destinations: nl2br is NOT applied to emails body if at least a < character is found in the email body. Then we assume it's a HTML email and don't apply nl2br.

===== 2.13.7 =====
 * Fixed an issue for export profiles that load the XSL Template from a file
 * Fixed warnings logged under certain circumstances

===== 2.13.8 =====

 * Updated Xtento_XtCore to version 2.11.0 ("Added Content Security Policy (CSP) support. XTENTO resources are whitelisted.")

===== 2.14.2 =====
 + Improved error handler for crashes: A notification email is now sent if "debug emails" are enabled and an error has been logged

===== 2.14.3 =====
 * Fixed an issue with "shutdown/crash" notices being logged about an unrelated Symfony error

===== 2.14.4 =====
 * Fixed an issue where "Profile Wizard" hangs/never finishes after loading a profile if "Create feed folder" option is enabled

===== 2.14.5 =====
 + Added nl2br renderer for log grid result message so log messages which contain new lines such as API responses are displayed on separate lines in the execution log
 * Disabled graceful die (to log fatal errors) as it also caused 3rd party errors to trigger false-positive warning emails
